- [x] Phase 1 complete through step 1.4 (Backend fixes + Clerk auth + clerk_id linking).
- [x] Phase 2.1 Install Zod and add reusable validate middleware (`src/middleware/validate.ts`).
- [x] Phase 2.2 Add schemas for all write endpoints (`/enrollments`, `/users`, `/users/:id`, `/users/:id/status`, `/users/sync`).
- [x] Phase 2.3 Standardize error format and add shared API error helper.
- [x] Phase 3 Set up `node-pg-migrate` and convert SQL files to migration scripts.
- [x] Phase 4 Add missing detail endpoints and pagination for list routes.
- [x] Phase 5 Add audit log table + write tracking on all mutations.
- [ ] Phase 6.1 Frontend app shell + role-aware navigation (`ADMIN`, `ES`, `AS`).
- [ ] Phase 6.2 ADMIN views: users/status management + audit log screen + maintenance overview.
- [ ] Phase 6.3 ES views: language selection, status controls, active assignments/offers.
- [ ] Phase 6.4 AS views: create transfer request (premise_id + timeslot) and tracking history.
- [x] Phase 6.5 Backend support for frontend role UX (ownership-scoped endpoints + stricter role guards).
- [x] Sanity 1: fix frontend endpoint contract mismatch by making dashboard requests role-aware.
- [x] Sanity 2: include admin audit-log loading in dashboard data path.
- [x] Sanity 3: pin Node runtime requirement (`.nvmrc`, package `engines`) for frontend/backend consistency.
- [x] Sanity 4: add backend `.env.example` for predictable environment setup.
- [x] Sanity 5: add migration status check command (`npm run migrate:status`).
- [x] Sanity 6: add auth/role smoke check command (`npm run smoke:auth`) for 401/403/200 validation.
- [x] Sanity 7: cleanup commit hygiene (`.gitignore` hardening for deps/build/backups).
- [ ] Phase 7 Add automated tests (dispatch fairness, race conditions, auth/role + core frontend flows).
- [ ] Phase 8 Railway deployment pipeline + health monitoring + runbook checks.
